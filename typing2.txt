Hello welcome to my Youtube channel, my name is Gayheart. 
I am 23 years of age learning how to program and build something efficient in thsi world 

Attended central University and met most of the amazing people i could ever come across,
learn't alot in the process .. 


thank you for your time , this is a git tutorial on practicing how to use the 
the GIT IGNORE command efficicently. 


git ignore can help you hide up or avoid pushing files that are a bit sensitive and 
of relevance to be seen by other contributors who are interest in forking your 
projects on git so for instance you have a passwords file section in your code or 
an API key file that you would not like others to have access you could use gitignore
so that when pushing the code to your public repository anyone interested in accessing 
the code would not access those files when your project is forked.... 


touch .gitignore 

        THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME !!!
